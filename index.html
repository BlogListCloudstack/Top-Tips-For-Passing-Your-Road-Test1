            <p>
                There are over <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2019/dl1c.cfm">5.3 million</a> licensed drivers in Arizona alone. Are you getting ready to get out on the road and become one? It’s time for you to take your road test.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you start browsing new types of cars and planning your first road trip, you have to impress a driving instructor and the tester. Are you ready?
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re here to talk about a few things that can make your road test less stressful. Read on for our top road test driving tips.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Practice, Practice, Practice</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best road test driving tips that anyone can give you is to make sure you get enough practice in before the big day. Practice doesn’t make perfect, but it does make you <i>improve</i>, and it will make you feel more confident on the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if you think you know everything for your test on paper, that doesn’t mean you’ll be able to apply it to a real-life driving situation. Too many people only practice as much as they actually have to because they want to “get it over with,” but this is a huge mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any time you have the opportunity to drive with an experienced driver, take it. Yes, it’s frightening at first, but this practice will make you feel much more comfortable when it’s time to take your test.

            <h2>Be Comfortable With Your Car </h2>
            <p>
                Whether you’re driving your <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/blog/mvd-title-transfer-guide/">own first car</a> or you’re driving a friend or family member’s car for your test, make sure you know it like the back of your hand. You never want to start in an unfamiliar vehicle for your road test.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take your test in a car that you’ve practiced in. There are several reasons for this.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, your test-giver will be watching you interact with your car before you start driving. They want to know that you’re able to adjust your mirrors and use the controls. If you can’t do this, the test may end before you even hit the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’ve already driven in a specific car, you’ll also feel more comfortable during your test. You won’t be trying to make last-minute adjustments or struggling to remember how to navigate the car’s controls. You can focus on the road.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Adapt</h2>
            <p>
                During some parts of your driving test, as well as your training, you may be in a “safe” situation, like a pre-made course. When you’re doing the actual road test, you’re suddenly going to be in a real-life driving environment and you won’t be able to anticipate everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you’re on the road, unexpected things happen. You need to be ready for anything. While you’re practicing for your road test, you want to prepare for this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While you shouldn’t practice driving in high-risk situations (such as bad weather) if you’re not ready for it, you should be driving on the actual road rather than just in parking lots or quiet back roads.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Pay Attention to Driving</h2>
            <p>
                This may seem obvious, but you’d be surprised. You need to focus on driving while you’re taking your driving test.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you’re taking your test, you may feel nervous. That’s normal! That nervousness may compel you to try to make conversation, fiddle with your radio (we’ve been there), or otherwise distract yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only does this not look good to your instructor, but it can also lead to mistakes, or worse, accidents.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The instructor may ask you questions about street signs or other features of the road. If you’re not paying attention, you won’t have the right answers. Focus.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Don’t Rush</h2>
            <p>
                When you’re feeling anxious during your test, you may just want to get it over with. Take a breath and slow down. Rushing is the last thing you want to do when you’re taking your road test.
            </p>
            <p>
                You want to make sure you go through every step of the process, and if that means going slowly and taking your time, so be it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This also applies to your actual driving. You don’t want to dip too low below the speed limit, but that’s far better than going above it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your driving test is not a race. Don’t treat it like one. 
            </p>

            <h2>Relax</h2>
            <p>
                Again, you’re sure to be feeling anxious during your test. That’s normal, but that anxiety could get in the way of your judgment and your good test results. Do your best to relax and calm down before you get on the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take some deep breaths. consider trying some <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques">grounding exercises</a> to bring you “back down” to earth. Maintain your focus and keep your eye on the prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your test won’t take long. Try to enjoy it.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Don’t Forget the Basics</h2>
            <p>
                Your driving instructor is going to be paying attention to everything you do, down to the basics. Try not to forget them!
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t focus on anything fancy. Instead, look both ways, check your mirrors, and never forget to use a turn signal. As long as you do these things, you’ll be in good shape.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Ask Questions for Clarification</h2>
            <p>
                During your road test, your driving instructor may give you instructions. If you need clarification, don’t be afraid to ask for it. Asking questions is okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, this has its limitations. Don’t ask your instructor what you should be doing or what road signs mean unless you’re ready to forget the test and you need to do so for your safety. It’s your responsibility to remember those things. 
            </p>
            <h2>Keep These Road Test Driving Tips in Mind for Your Test</h2>
            <p>
                Worried about your driving test? Don’t be. These road test driving tips will help. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As long as you practice, pay attention to your driving, and try to stay relaxed, you’ll be in the clear. Remember, people get their driver’s licenses every day. You’re ready for it!
